          <p>
            Motivated IT student seeking an internship as an IT Operation
            Intern. I offer strong analytical skills, a foundation in IT
            concepts, and a proactive learning attitude. Despite limited
            experience, my coursework has equipped me with a solid understanding
            of systems analysis and project methodologies. Eager to bridge the
            gap between academia and industry, I am confident that my passion
            for learning and commitment to excellence will contribute
            effectively to your team during the internship.
