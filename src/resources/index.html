        <p>
          Motivated IT student seeking an internship as an IT Operation Intern.
          I offer strong analytical skills, a foundation in IT concepts, and a
          proactive learning attitude. Despite limited experience, my coursework
          has equipped me with a solid understanding of systems analysis and
          project methodologies. Eager to bridge the gap between academia and
          industry, I am confident that my passion for learning and commitment
          to excellence will contribute effectively to your team during the
          internship.
